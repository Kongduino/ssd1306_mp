# ssd1306_mp

A fork of the ssd1206 library for Micropython. It adds the `rotate180()` method, which was absent. I am planning to add more features as I go.

Tested on an [Elecfreaks Wukong 2040]https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-wukong2040-expansion-board-adapter-for-raspberry-pi-pico, donated by [Elecfreaks](https://github.com/elecfreaks), and an original Pico.
